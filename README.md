### Single Responsbility Principle
A SOLID Principle, "A class should have one, and only one, reason to change."

### Dry code
Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

### KISS
Keep it simple stupid, most systems work best if they are kept simple, rather than made complicated.
