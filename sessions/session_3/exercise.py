# Please create a class that is responsible for representing coding systems, specifically snomed codes.
# The class should
#   - Generate a unique identifier
#   - Have an active date range
# The snomed class should have the identifier and date range as an attribute assigned by the classes method
# The snomed class should inherit from a generic ClinicalCodes class and any attributes and methods you deem worthy
# Consider whether it is applicable to apply overriding.
# 
# Note: no need to add implementation - I want the shell of the classes.
